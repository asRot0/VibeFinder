**Discover music that matches your vibe!**

## ðŸŒŸ **What is VibeFinder?**
VibeFinder is an intelligent music recommendation system designed to suggest songs based on your current mood or a favorite track. Using cutting-edge machine learning techniques and the Spotify Million Song Dataset, VibeFinder analyzes similarities between tracks to bring you personalized music recommendations, complete with album covers.

## ðŸ§  **How Does It Work?**
1. **Input Selection**: Choose a song from a dropdown menu.
2. **Song Analysis**: 
   - Songs are represented as high-dimensional feature vectors derived from their audio properties (e.g., tempo, energy, danceability).
   - Cosine similarity is calculated to find tracks most similar to your selection.
3. **Recommendations**:
   - Display top recommendations in an interactive UI.
   - Optionally, preview songs (using Spotify API).

## ðŸ”¬ **AI/ML Techniques Used**
- **Feature Engineering**: Extraction of audio features from the dataset for similarity computation.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures closeness of song feature vectors.
- **Streamlit**: Deploys the app for an interactive and user-friendly interface.
